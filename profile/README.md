# Trainberry - Welcome! 👋

Trainberry is an **open-source** and **open-hardware** project designed to enable the digital control of electric trains
(HO scale) through open, extensible, and accessible technologies for everyone.

The entire project is distributed under the [AGPLv3 License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html)
and was originally initiated by [Florian Forestier](https://github.com/florian-forestier/).
All suggestions and contributions are welcome!

## Project Origins

The idea for this project dates back to 2012, when my grandfather and I started expanding our small electric train layout.
At the time, we went from a coffee table–sized layout to a full ping-pong table (before adding an extra switching yard).
We were then faced with the problems inherent to analog train control: direction and speed were defined for all trains
at once, which inevitably led to collisions.

Due to lack of resources and knowledge, we stuck with the analog approach until 2024,
when I discovered [Thierry Chantier’s talk about TinyGo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74DDxF6Jqm0).
That was all it took to revive the idea!
